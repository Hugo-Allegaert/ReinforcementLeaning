# Reinforcement Learning

The objective was to resolve the game Taxi-v3 from Gym library by using reinforcement learning algorithm.  
To achieve it I implemented my version of :
* Q-Learning
* Deep Q-Learning
* Double Deep Q-Learning
* PPO

You can find the tests, results and comparisons of the 4 algorithm into the jupyter notebooks and the source code into ./src folders.
